Introduction
Hangman is a word guessing game where players try to guess a word by suggesting letters. 
A correct guess reveals the letter's position in the word, 
while an incorrect guess brings the player closer to losing.




Usage
To play the game, simply run the hangman.py script in your terminal. You will be prompted to guess letters one at a time.

The game will display the word as a series of underscores (e.g., _ _ _ _ _).
You will input your guess (a single letter at a time).
The game will either reveal the guessed letter's position in the word or show an incorrect guess.
Keep guessing until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.




Game Rules
The game will start by displaying a series of underscores representing the hidden word.
You will have 6 incorrect guesses before you lose the game.
For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman will be drawn (head, body, arms, and legs).
You win if you guess the word correctly before running out of guesses.
You lose if the entire hangman is drawn before you guess the word.
